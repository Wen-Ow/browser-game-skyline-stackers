        Welcome to Skyline Stackers, where the classic block-stacking gameplay you love meets the thrill of designing a glowing city skyline! Step into the role of an urban architect and strategically stack and clear blocks to light up towering skyscrapers. Your goal is simple: stack pieces to clear lines, score big, and keep up with the pace before the blocks pile too high. Are you ready to build the city of your dreams? Let's get started!
