## Description

In Skyline Stackers, the classic tetris game is reimagined against the backdrop of a city skyline. Players take on the role of an urban architect, strategically stacking and clearing blocks to illuminate the city's skyscrapers.

Can you keep with up with the pace and construct the skyline before the blocks pile too high? It's time to stack smart and make the city shine like never before.
