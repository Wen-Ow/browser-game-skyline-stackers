## Description

In ***Skyline Stackers***, the classic tetris game is reimagined against the backdrop of a city skyline. Players take on the role of an urban architect, strategically stacking and clearing blocks to illuminate the city's skyscrapers.

Why did I decide to create ***Skyline Stackers***? I enjoy arcade games so I wanted to combine the fun of a classic block-stacking game with the thrill of designing a skyline. It's not just about clearing lines, it's about improving spatial awareness, strategic planning, and quick decision-making, all while enjoying a relaxing yet challenging gameplay experience. 

Can you keep up with the pace and construct the skyline before the blocks pile too high? It's time to stack smart and make the city shine like never before.

## Objectives

- **Clear Lines:** Align and stack tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines and clear them from the board.
- **Build the Skyline:** Clear lines and progress through levels.
- **Score Points:** Earn points for every cleared line, with bonuses for combo clears of multiple lines.
- **Survive and Progress:** Keep the tetrominoes from reaching the top of the screen while advancing to higher levels with faster block drops.

## How To Play

1. **Start the Game:** Click the "Play" button to begin.
2. **Move Blocks:** Use the following controls to position tetris blocks.
- Left Arrow: Move left
- Right Arrow: Move right

3. **Clear Lines:** Align blocks to fill horizontal lines completely to clear them.
4. **Track Progress:** Watch your score and level increase as you play.
5. **Game Over:** The game ends when the blocks stack to the top of the screen.
6. **Restart:** Click "Restart" to play again.
